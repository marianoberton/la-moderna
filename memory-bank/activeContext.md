# Active Context

## Current Focus
The current development focus is on refining and enhancing the user interface components, particularly:

1. **CtaExchange Component**: Recently updated to integrate WhatsApp functionality for direct customer communication, replacing the previous form-based approach. The component now features a clean design with a WhatsApp-themed call-to-action button.

2. **Vehicle Showcase Components**: Previously worked on ensuring consistent widths and spacing for `FeaturedNew.tsx` and `UsedCars.tsx` components, particularly on mobile views.

## Recent Changes

### CtaExchange Component
- Implemented WhatsApp integration with a pre-filled message for vehicle quotation
- Redesigned the visual appearance to highlight the WhatsApp functionality
- Removed references to "respuestas en 24hs" and "planes a medida" as per user requirements
- Added WhatsApp icon and branding colors to the call-to-action
- Simplified the benefits section to focus on key advantages

### Vehicle Showcase Components
- Adjusted padding and margins to ensure consistent widths
- Improved carousel navigation arrow positioning to prevent overflow issues
- Standardized the layout approach between different vehicle showcase components
- Enhanced mobile responsiveness for better user experience

## In-Progress Decisions

### WhatsApp Integration Strategy
- Currently using direct WhatsApp links with pre-filled messages
- Considering whether to add tracking or analytics to measure conversion rates
- Need to determine the final phone number to use for the WhatsApp contact

### UI Refinement
- Evaluating whether additional UI improvements are needed for mobile devices
- Considering if other components should adopt a similar WhatsApp integration approach

## Next Steps
1. Validate the WhatsApp integration with real-world testing
2. Further refine UI components based on feedback
3. Consider implementing analytics to track user engagement with the WhatsApp CTA
4. Review overall site performance and responsiveness
5. Apply consistent design patterns across remaining components
