# La Moderna Project Rules

## Design Patterns

### Styling Conventions
- Use Tailwind CSS for all styling
- Follow mobile-first approach (default styles for mobile, then use breakpoint utilities)
- Maintain consistent padding and margin patterns:
  - Container padding: `px-4 sm:px-6`
  - Component spacing: `gap-4 sm:gap-6`
  - Section spacing: `py-8 sm:py-12`

### Component Structure
- Each major feature should be in its own component file
- Use 'use client' directive for components that use client-side functionality
- Follow consistent import order: React/Next.js imports, then UI components, then utilities

### Animation Patterns
- Use Framer Motion for animations
- Maintain consistent animation patterns:
  - Initial state definitions
  - Consistent transition properties (duration, ease)
  - Use staggered delays for sequential animations

### Responsive Design
- Default layouts should be for mobile (vertical stacking)
- Use flex-col for mobile, switching to flex-row for desktop
- Use grid layouts with appropriate column counts for different screen sizes
- Maintain consistent breakpoints:
  - sm: 640px
  - md: 768px
  - lg: 1024px
  - xl: 1280px

## Naming Conventions
- PascalCase for component names
- camelCase for variables and functions
- kebab-case for CSS class names
- Use descriptive names that clearly indicate purpose

## WhatsApp Integration
- Use the standard WhatsApp URL format: `https://wa.me/{number}?text={encodedMessage}`
- Always encode message text with `encodeURIComponent`
- Use the WhatsApp brand color (#25D366) for WhatsApp-related UI elements

## Project Organization
- Keep all main page components in `app/` directory
- Place shared UI components in `app/components/`
- Place shadcn/ui components in `components/ui/`
- Use appropriate icons from Lucide React library

## Performance Guidelines
- Optimize images before importing
- Lazy load components when appropriate
- Use proper semantic HTML for better accessibility
- Keep animation complexity reasonable for mobile devices

## Component Responsibilities
- `FeaturedNew`: Showcase new vehicle inventory with carousel navigation
- `UsedCars`: Display used vehicles with similar carousel structure
- `CtaExchange`: Promote vehicle exchange service with WhatsApp integration
